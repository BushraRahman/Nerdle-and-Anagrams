# Nerdle and Anagrams
Anagrams:
You will be provided with a word, and your task is to type its anagram! 
There are two modes of this game. 
In 'Continuous', guess as many anagrams as you'd like, and quit at any time by pressing 'Q'.
In 'Timed', guess as many anagrams as you can in a 30 second period.

Nerdle:
Within 6 tries, enter an equation with 8 characters that is exactly the same as the secret chosen equation.
The accepted characters are the numbers 1-9,+,-,/, *, and =. No decimals are allowed. The left side of the equation must have at least one operation.
Green represents a character in the right spot, blue is a correct character in the wrong spot, and grey is either a wrong character or a character that appears in your guess more than it does in the solution.
